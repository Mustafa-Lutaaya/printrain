Developed as an End of Semester Project, it was inspired by the challenges many new code learners face in maintaining focus while filled with distractions. 

It was built with the intention of offering a more comfortable and distraction-free environment for those who find it hard to focus, especially for those with diverse backgrounds and experiences.

Print(rain) combines interactive Python lessons with the calming effect of rain sounds, providing a peaceful and immersive space to help learners stay focused and motivated.
